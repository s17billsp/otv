Find out who is live from OfflineTV, their latest YouTube videos and Tweets.

### Livestreams
Using the [Interactive Frames for Live Streams](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed/video-and-clips#interactive-frames-for-live-streams-and-vods) from Twitch I have embeded all OTV Twitch channels.
*Unfortunately the Facebook API is pretty restrictive and would require a lot of work (and a Facebook account that I don't have) to integrate Toast here.*

### YouTube
Using the [YouTube Embedded Players](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#Manual_IFrame_Embeds) iframe, I can use the "Uploads" playlist from each channel to show their latest video.

### Twitter
Using the [Twitter Embedded profile timeline](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/timelines/guides/profile-timeline) I show an embed for each member's twitter timeline to show their latest tweets.

This is a fan made project, I am not part of OfflineTV, I just wanted a place to get all the latest content.
